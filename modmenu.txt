How to use this dll

Start the dll injector
type "pcsx" and press enter
type "sly" and press enter
then you wait on the ready screen

start your game
while the game is loading in, inject (aka press enter one more time on the injector)
this has to be done before paris loads in

now that you are ready, here's how the menu works:

Page Down: Opens/Closes the menu
Up/Down arrows: navigate the menu / go up or down, respectively, in noclip (requires the menu to be closed)
Left arrow: go back in the menu

Tips for noclip: jump before you enable it. this way you will be able to navigate with your joystick.
Also, disable before you load into some other level or map. Otherwise you will crash when you land on the ground.

The hooks work this way: the first time that an event happens in the game that is tied to the hooks, it will replace the code with the custom code
this usually means that the first time you do the event, the custom code won't actually execute.

Godmode also only works for specific guards atm, because the animations are different for some enemies.
